## Design & Planning:

### User Stories
The features of this project are based on the following user stories:

- As a visiting user, I want to navigate the site easily.
- As a visiting user, I want to know what classes and services are provided by the studio.
- As a visiting user, I want to see images of the studio, classes, and events.

### Wireframes
Attach wireframes in this section

### Typography
I used https://fonts.google.com/ to pick my fonts. I started just using the fonts I used for the Love Running Project and changed to DM Sans for my headings and Poppins for my body. I like the simplicity of these fonts I think they are easy to read and go well with my brand.

- **Primary Color**: #D1B1C8 (soft pink/purple)
- **Secondary Color**: #544750 (dark purple)


## Features:
### Navigation

## Bugs
I ran my code through validator and learned that I had spaces in my photo name so I went back in a fixed that so there was no spaces. 
I resized the photos for each page for better optimisation.
